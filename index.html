        <!-- Paragraphs explaining climate change -->
        <h3 id="index3">
            <p>Climate, refers to the long-term regional or global average of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades.</p>
            <p>While the weather can change in just a few hours, climate changes over longer timeframes. Climate change is the significant variation of average weather conditions becoming, for example, warmer, wetter, or drier—over several decades or longer. It is the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability.</p>
            <p><b>Climate change</b> refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. It's primarily driven by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes.</p><br>
            <p><b>Climate change</b> is caused by increases in the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere, which cause the earth’s average temperature to rise.</p><br>
            <p>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising air and sea temperatures. They are primarily produced through the burning of fossil fuels (like coal) for electricity generation, as well as through agricultural, mining, land management and transport practices.</p><br>
            <p>The effects of climate change are already being felt. Because of global warming, Australia’s climate has warmed on average by 1.4°C since official Bureau of Meteorology records began in 1910.</p><br>
            <p><b>In Victoria, the average temperature has increased by just over 1.0°C across the state since 1910. With this amount of warming, Victoria is already experiencing:</b></p><br>
           <ul>
            <li>an increase in the frequency of days of <b><a href="#">extreme heat</a></b></li>
            <li>an increase in dangerous fire weather and length of fire seasons</li>
            <li>a decline in cool season rainfall, resulting in the lowest streamflow on record over the past decades</li>
            <li>a rise in sea levels.</li>
           </ul>
           <p><b>In recent decades, Victoria's climate has changed by becoming warmer and drier. Victorian climate projections by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology suggest these changes will continue into the future. Climate projections for Victoria suggest:</b></p>
           <ul>
            <li>
                further increases in the number of very hot days and extreme heat
            </li>
            <li>the number of very high fire danger days increasing and the fire season being prolonged</li>
            <li>average annual rainfalls decreasing and a continuous decline in streamflow affecting the health of waterways and Victorian water supplies</li>
            <li>extreme rainfall being of a higher intensity, potentially increasing the risk of flash flooding in some locations</li>
            <li>coastal sea levels continuing to rise.</li>

         <h2><b>Health effects of climate change</b></h2>
        <br>
        <p>Climate change has been described by the World Health Organization as the biggest threat to health in the 21st century – it affects health and wellbeing in many ways:</p> <br>
             <ul>
                 <li>Directly, by the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events (such as heatwaves, floods and bushfires); and</li>
                 <li>Indirectly, through worsening air quality, changes in the spread of infectious diseases, threats to food and water and effects on mental health.</li>
                 <p>Climate change will also impact certain parts of the economy with increased unemployment, financial stress, food insecurity, and rising social inequalities.</p>
             </ul>
      
 
         <!-- Paragraphs explaining why climate change matters -->
     <br>   <b>Who is most at risk of health effects due to climate change? <br>
            Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and health: <br>
      </b> <br>
             <ul>
                 <li>Children are vulnerable for several reasons. For example, children are more susceptible to heat stress and dehydration and 
                    are more sensitive to exposure to air pollution and smoke from bushfires. Their immune systems are not fully developed, putting them at increased risk of infections. 
                    They often need to rely on adults to keep them safe during emergencies and help them to recover afterwards.</li> <br>
                <li>Pregnant women are at increased risk of heat stress during heatwaves due to the physiological demands of pregnancy. They and their unborn babies are particularly sensitive to exposure to air pollution and smoke from bushfires.</li> <br>
                <li>Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are more prone to dehydration, heat stress, infections and exacer bation of heart and lung disease.
                </li> <br>
                <li>People living in rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people on low incomes and other vulnerable populations are also at increased risk,
                     in part due to inequalities in underlying health outcomes and limited accessibility of healthcare and other services.
                     People living in rural or remote communities or along the coast are also at risk from extreme events such as bushfires, droughts, storms and sea level rises.</li><br>
             </ul>
                <p><b>How to cope and stay safe in extreme heat</b></p> <br>
                <p>Over the last century, average temperatures in Australia have increased and heatwaves have become longer, hotter and more frequent
                    . This trend is expected to continue as the world gets even warmer. You can stay healthy in the heat by: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>drinking plenty of water</li>
                    <li>never leaving anyone in a car
                    </li>
                    <li>staying somewhere cool</li>
