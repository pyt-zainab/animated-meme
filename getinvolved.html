   <h3>The urgency to address climate change stems from its profound impact on our planet and all life forms.
    Here are several compelling reasons why we must take action in addition effect of climate change written in the home page:
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Global warming and Extreme Weather: </b>Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have led to a rise in averae temperatures worldwide. 
    This global warming trend disrupts our climate, resulting in more intense droughts, devasting floods, wildfires, and stores. Even a half degree Celsius increase matters significantly.</li><br>
    <li><b>Environmental Consequences: </b>Climate change affects ouur ecosystems, agriculture, health, and water supply. 
        Changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events are already impacting people and communities.</li>
        <li><b>Biodiversity: </b>Animals like leopards, turtles, and polar bears face significant challenges due to climate change.
        Protecting their habitats and preserving biodiversity is crucial</li>
        <li>Extreme hot days would be on average 4C warmer at mid-latitudes (regions outside the poles and tropics), versus 3C at 1.5C
        </li>
        <li>Sea-level rise would be 0.1m higher than at 1.5C, exposing up to 10 million more people to events including more frequent flooding</li> 
        <li>More than 99% of coral reefs would be lost, compared with 70-90% at 1.5C</li>
        <li>Twice the number of plants and vertebrates (animals with a backbone) would be exposed to unsuitable climate conditions across more than half the geographical area where they are found</li>
        <li>Several hundred million more people may be exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by 2050 than at 1.5C.</li>
        <li>huge declines in Arctic sea-ice</li>
        <li>rapid melting of glaciers and ice sheets, contributing to sea-level rise</li>
        <h3>What are the government doing to stop climate change</h3>
       <p>In a landmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.</p>
       <p>To achieve this, "net zero" CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050. Net zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere. Most countries have, or are considering, net zero targets <br> 
        However, greenhouse gas levels are still rising quickly and the world is "likely" to warm beyond 1.5C, the IPCC says. <br>
        World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments. <br>
        The most recent UN climate change summit, COP28, was held in the United Arab Emirates. For the first time, countries agreed to "contribute" to "transitioning away from fossil fuels", although they are not forced to take action.
    <br>

 </ul> <br>
    <h3>Having said the effect, it is neccessary to state the pratical steps needed to help climate change.<br>
    Here are <b>10 pratical ways</b> you can contribute to fighting the climate crisis:</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spread the word: </b>Encourage your friends, family, and co-workers to reduce their carbon pollution. Join global movements like <a href="#"><b>Count Us In</b></a>, which aims 
        to inspire <b>1 billion people</b> to take practical steps and challenge leaders to act more boldly on climate change. And as qandra brian onced said, it is never too late to start<!--add quote--></li>
        <li><b>Keep up the political pressure: </b>Lobby local politicians and bussinesses to support efforts in cutting emissions and reducing carbon pollution.
        Your voice matters, and politicians must be part of the solutions. Arrange meetings with your local representatives and advocate for change.</li>
        <li><b>Transform your Transport: </b>Transportation accounts for around a quater of all green house gas emmissions. Whenever possible, 
            leave your car at home and walk or cycle. Consider using public transportation or electric vechicles to reduce your carbon footprint.</li>
            <li><b>Rein in your Power Use:</b> Be mindful of energy consumption. Switch to renewable sources like solar and wind energy to power your home.
            Small changes, such as using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights when not needed, make a difference.</li>
        <li><b>Tweak Your Diet:</b> Opt for a more sustainable diet. Reduce meat consumption, especially beef, which has a higher carbon footprint. Choose 
        locally sourced and seasonal foods. Every meal choice counts towards a greener planet.</li>
        <li><b>Shop Local and Buy Sustainable:</b> Support local bussiness and products. Choose items with minimal packaging and consider their environment impact.
        Sustainable choices extend beyond food to clothing, electronics, and other goods.</li>
        <li><b>Don't waste food:</b> Food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Plan meals, store food properly, and use leftovers creatively.
             By reducing food waste, you help conserve resources and reduce emissions.</li>
             <li><b>Dress(Climate) Smart:</b> Be mindful of your clothing choices. Opt for sustainable fabrics, buy secondhand, and avoid fast fashion. 
            Supporting eco-friendly brands promotes a more sustainable industry.</li>
            <li><b>Nurture Soils and Grasslands:</b> Healthy soils and grasslands act as carbon sinks. Support regenerative agriculture pratices that enhance soil health
            and sequester carbon. Composting and planting trees also contribute to soil restortion.</li>
            <li><b>Support Research and Organizations:</b> Back research initiatives and organizations working on climate solutions. Whether through 
            donations, volunteering, or spreading awareness, your support matters in the fight against climate change.</li>
    </ul>
         <p>Remember, our fragile planet hangs in the balance, and urgent action is essential. Lets work together to safeguard our environment for current and better generations.
